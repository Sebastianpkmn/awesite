    This is a personal Website made by me. This site is currently under
    construction, but I'll make sure that there is always a working version
    available.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, I wanted to make this website really goofy, but as the Website
    grew, I felt like this approach isn't really what I wanted. This Website
    needed a new, fresh design, which is the one I am working on rn.
    <br /><br />
   The Content of the Website is random. I don't even know myself.
